Homework-2 description:

For this assignment, I used html, CSS stylesheet, and bootstrap style elements to create three webpages to showcase myself and my brand. The theme is my alma-mater's colors (using the official hex colors for the navy and yellow). Each page layout included:
1. A navy blue Navbar with my name capitalized on the top left next to yellow buttons (with a double navy border), a search bar and button on the top-right of that Navbar, and a border-bottom. The buttons on my Navbar link to my 'About Me' page, my 'Portfolio' page, my social media pages (in a dropdown menu), and my 'Contact Me' page. My capitalized name is also a button linking to the 'About Me' homepage. On mobile/small screens, the search Navbar disappears and instead there is a yellow outline button (with a dropdown menu when clicked). 
2. A grey background
3. A container with a navy background and double yellow border. Each container has a padding as to not touch the Navbar or the footer. The Profile page has a large h1 header with two h5 headers before each body paragraph. The image is floated to the left of the text. The Portolio page also has a large h1 header with two centered rows and columns for the images. All images are centered and sized for height & width of 100%. The Contact page has a form with three text fields.
4. A yellow footer with a double blue top-border and text centered in the footer. 
Also, all buttons on my webpages have both hover effects and action effects and they reset the text fields but they do not send the text anywhere.

PS: all the tabs on my page link to the respective pages and the links to my social media are in the "Social Media" tab.
