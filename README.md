I have revised my responsive portfolio to integrate the bootstrap grid and present my portfolio in a more polished, professional manner. I have included buttons to the left of the page that direct users to my LinkedIn profile, my GitHub page, and my current resume. I also updated the portfolio page to showcase my two projects and four best homework assignments completed to date at the UW Coding Bootcamp.
